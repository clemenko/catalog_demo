# Rancher Helm Chart Repository - air gap v3

This repository contains Helm charts that are used for demonstration purposes.

**The Helm charts in this repository are not production ready and are meant for demonstration purposes only!**

This demo is designed to use a local `gitea` repo with all the files.

```bash
kubectl  apply -f http://git.rfed.me/gitea/catalog_demo/raw/branch/main/fleet.yaml
```

This will add the navlinks and the local catalog repository.
